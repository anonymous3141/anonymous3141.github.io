I enjoy solving fun problems, especially if they involve math and computers. Currently, I am interested in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on generative modelling and its applications. Problems I am interested in include:

- What are the most effective approaches for modelling different (multi)-modalities of data â€” diffusion, autoregressive, or more novel alternatives?

- How can generative models be fine-tuned, adapted, and steered to address practical objectives?

- How can we algorithmically improve the efficiency and scalability of generative models?

I completed my studies in mathematics and computer science at Trinity College, Cambridge University. I also work in quantitative finance.
