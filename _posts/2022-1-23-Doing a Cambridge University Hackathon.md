# Hack Cambridge

(Oh yes, I forgot to mention, I'm a Cambridge Student now, studying Maths at Trinity College UwU)

I was in the last two days very privileged to participate in Cambridge University's flagship hackathon event, Hack Cambridge, having made a last minute entry. It was my great pleasure to participate in a team alongside Trinity College computer science students Bence, Jakob and from Kings college, Kornel, and am grateful for the kind invitation they extended to me to participate with them. I am also thankful for the opportunity to meet with many sponsors of the event, such as Optiver, Jane Street and Blackrock.

Our team as a whole was very much pleased to have produced a very satisfactory piece of software in 24 hours of hacking, and were very pleased to be considered as one of the top 6 entries in the final round of judging, being awarded the Wolfram prize for our efforts.

The event was very tiring, but I enjoyed it very much and the rapport and teamwork between our team was amazing. This is not to mention the heaps of free swag from sponsors, and the prize won was only the cherry on the cake.

## End Product
Our end product was called Green Analytics, a toolkit to help ordinary investors trade an currently illiquid asset "European Carbon Allowances" containing 3 machine learning models (sentiment analysis, time series price forecasting and electricity consumption prediction) to help price the asset. Our hopes was that it would drive up demand in secondary markets for the asset and thus increase its price, and thereby make it more costly for companies to pollute.

In all we captured the essence of the idea well, and although our models fall well short of production quality, nevertheless achieve nontrivial performance
