## Algorithms regarding to Trees
Trees is one of the greatest areas in graph theory covered in informatics contests, and is increasing in popularity rapidly. In this blog we cover some tree algorithms.
### Notation
$h_\theta(x) = \Large\frac{1}{1 + \mathcal{e}^{(-\theta^\top x)}}$ ;

### Two Lemmas on the diameter
1. Two diameter oaths must share an edge
2. For any node <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v\in \mathcal{T}">, the furthest node <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u">
