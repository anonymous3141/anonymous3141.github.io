## My Blog

Hey there, thanks for visiting my blog :) I'm Junhua, an Australian computer science and maths enthusiast who just graduated high school (as of December 2020). Thus far, my main exposure to CS and maths is through olympiads. I represented Australia in the IOI (international olympiad in informatics) and also did well in the Australia Maths Olympiad (AMO). However, I'm really excited to explore a wider range of CS and Maths tools and their applications now that there are no more olympiads to do. You will find my explorations, as well as good olympiad competitive programming ideas on this blog (and maybe some other stuff too UwU). Anyway, good to meet you (>w<)

### Notes of a machine learning beginner
I decided to start learning keras to do some basic ML. This is where I place my notes.
